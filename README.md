**Problem:** During this unprecedented pandemic, people are sometimes misinformed about the need to wear masks and social distance in large groups. Large gatherings may be harmful to those participating as well those passing by. 

**Solution:** We are proposing to create a mobile app (maskFORCE) that allows people to alert others of areas that have big gatherings that are not practicing social distancing or wearing any protective gear, as well as allow local volunteers to respond to the area to educate and provide masks. Therefore there are two interfaces, one for the people reporting (reporters) locations and the second for those responding to the alerts (responders). For reporters, they can add a report, see other reports by other people on a feed, as well as look at a map to see where the reports of people gathering are. For responders, the only difference is that they can choose to respond to a report. 
Thus the flow would be:
1. Someone creates a report
2. An alert is sent to others with the app who are near that community
3. A local volunteer can select to respond to the location to handout masks as well as educate them on COVID19.  

maskFORCE would provide a way for communities to easily communicate and help stop the spread of COVID19.
